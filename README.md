Foureye: Hypergame Defense Framework

Foureye is a hypergame theory-based defensive deception framework designed to protect against Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). It models attacker–defender interactions under uncertainty to improve threat detection and system resilience.

🔰 Key Features
- Models attacker and defender behavior using hypergame theory.
- Detects Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) with deceptive feedback.
- Interactive web interface for user and service provider roles.
- Tracks detection status and interaction history.
- Built using Python and Django with HTML/CSS frontend.
